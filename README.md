# Smartphone Sales Analysis
## Dataset Description
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. You can download the data from this link: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubham2703/smartphone-retail-outlet-sales-data/data). This dataset captures the transactions of a fictional retail company over a fiscal year (2018–2019). It provides valuable insights into the sales of smartphone accessories. The dataset is organized into several columns, each representing different aspects of the transactions.

Power Query is a data transformation and data preparation tool that allows you to connect, combine, and refine data from various sources before loading it into Power BI for analysis.
To load the dataset into Power BI, follow these steps:
   - Click on “Get Data” in the Home tab.
   - Select the appropriate data source (e.g., Excel, CSV, etc.).
   - Choose the downloaded dataset file.
   - Open the file and select the desired sheet or table.
   - Apply any necessary data cleaning and transformation steps using Power Query.
